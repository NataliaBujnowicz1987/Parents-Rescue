Owning a big country house they established pre and after-school service where children have few playrooms, library,TV room, kitchen as well as sleep room at their disposal. There is also a big garden with forestry access. Parents Rescue House is located in the vicinity of spectacular Emo Court, co. Laois. The gardens at Emo are 35 hectares of landscaped grounds, with formal areas, woodland walks,statues and a 20-acre lake – a feature of neoclassical landscape design.
